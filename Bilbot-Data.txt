Easy to implement
Works on sorted & unsorted data
No need for preprocessing (like sorting)
Efficient for small datasets
Best case runs in O(1) time (if the element is first)
Slow for large datasets (O(n) complexity)
Not efficient compared to binary search
Consumes more time for large lists
Requires sequential scanning
No improvement even if the data is sorted
Start at the first element
Compare the target value with the current element
If found, return the index
If not, move to the next element
Repeat until the end of the list
If the element is not found, return -1
Works for arrays, lists, and linked lists
Can be implemented using loops or recursion
Used in both iterative and recursive approaches
Does not require additional space (O(1) space complexity)
Best case: O(1) (Element found at the beginning)
Worst case: O(n) (Element found at the end or not found)
Average case: O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n)
Space complexity: O(1) (No extra space needed)
Comparison with binary search (O(log n))

Faster than linear search
O(log n) time complexity
Efficient for large datasets
Ideal for sorted data
Less comparisons needed
Requires sorted data
Overhead in sorting (if unsorted initially)
Not efficient for small datasets
Complex to implement recursively
Difficult to use in dynamically changing data
Start with a sorted array
Find the middle element
Compare it with the target value
If equal, return index
If target is smaller, search the left half
If target is larger, search the right half
Repeat until the target is found or the range is empty
Can be implemented using iteration or recursion
Requires log(n) comparisons
Works best when searching frequently in sorted data
Best case: O(1) (Element found at midpoint)
Worst case: O(log n) (Repeated halving required)
Average case: O(log n)
Space complexity: O(1) (Iterative) / O(log n) (Recursive)
